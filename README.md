# SerialDataLogger
I need to connect to a serial port and be able to store data and plot it in the time and frequency domains.
  Requires Anaconda 3.7
  I've added a test hex file for the microchip Xpress board using pic16F18855
  To list Anaconda environments: conda info --envs
  To select an environment: conda activate py37
  To make sure conda is in your path, edit bashrc in your home path:
  vi ~/.bashrc and apend this to the end:
  . /opt/archiconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
